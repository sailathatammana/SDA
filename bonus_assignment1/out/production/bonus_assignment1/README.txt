---BONUS ASSIGNMENT 1---

Instructions:
	1: 	Implement the Rectangle class fully according to the comments.
		I.e. add fields, constructors, and implement methods "area" and 
		"circumreference".
	2: 	Create a Triangle class on your own with the same methods, using
		the Line class as well.
	3: 	Create a rectangle and triangle in the main method in the Main 
		class using the Point, Line, and Rectangle classes. Print the 
		area and circumreference to console.
	
	(ADVANCED)
	4: 	Implement a method "isIntersecting" in the classes Line, Rectangle, 
		and Triangle which checks if an given object of the same class 
		(Line, Rectangle, Triangle respectively) overlaps with the current
		object.(returning true/false)
	
Feedback:
	If you want feedback on your implementation gather all source files 
	(.java files) in one repository and zip (compress) it. Send it in the #code-dump
	channel on Slack and request feedback, where Johan and coursemates can review the
	code. If you feel uncomfortable showing your code to others, send it in a PM to
	Johan over Slack. (Time constraints limit the extents of my feedback.)
